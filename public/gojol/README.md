Drop your gojol MP3 files here with the following filename convention:

- Use the file names exactly as referenced in the app (no spaces):
  - Hasbi_Rabbi_Jallallah.mp3
  - Salam_Official_Song.mp3
  - Allah_Allah_Islamic_Song.mp3
  - Hridoy_Majhe_Mala_Gath.mp3
  - Ami_Dekhini_Tomay.mp3
  - Baba_Koto_Din_Holo_Dekhini_Tor.mp3
  - Hothat_Azrail_Pathaiya_Toke.mp3
  - O_Modinar_Bulbuli.mp3
  - Allahor_Voy.mp3
  - Rongin_E_Prithibi_Charite_Hoibe.mp3
  - Salat_Kayem_Koro.mp3
  - Tri_Vuboner_Priyo_Muhammad.mp3

Examples:
- Copy/drag `Hasbi_Rabbi_Jallallah.mp3` into this folder so the app can play `/gojol/Hasbi_Rabbi_Jallallah.mp3`.

Notes:
- Files in `public/` are served from the root in development and production. After adding files, restart the dev server if necessary.
- Filenames should match exactly (case-sensitive on some servers).
- The service worker already caches `*.mp3`; placing files here will make them available for PWA caching.

If you want me to rename files automatically or add metadata files, tell me and I can add a small script to validate filenames.
